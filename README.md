# Crop Compass

**Crop Compass** is Rule-based simplified AI-driven crop recommendation system designed to help farmers in Kenya choose the best crops for specific regions. By providing tailored crop recommendations based on local climate and soil conditions, Crop Compass aims to enhance agricultural productivity and contribute to food security.
